CONTRIBUTING

    Thank you for considering contributing to App::Reorder::TSV.

    The source is hosted on GitHub:

      https://github.com/iansealy/perl-App-Reorder-TSV

    If you find a bug or have a feature request then please file an
    issue:

      https://github.com/iansealy/perl-App-Reorder-TSV/issues

    If you have cpanm installed then you can satisfy dependencies like
    this:

      cpanm --installdeps --with-develop .

    You can run tests directly using the prove tool:

      prove -l

    The distribution is managed with Dist::Zilla, so many of the usual
    files you might expect are not in the repository but are generated
    at release time. Some generated files are kept in the repository as
    a convenience (e.g. Makefile.PL, META.json and META.yml).

    If you have Dist::Zilla installed then you can install any required
    plugins like this:

      dzil authordeps --missing | cpanm

    And, if you haven't already, you can satisfy dependencies like
    this:

      dzil listdeps --missing --develop | cpanm

    Some useful dzil commands include:

      dzil test
      dzil build
